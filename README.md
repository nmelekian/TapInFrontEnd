# TapIn

TapIn Admin is a project designed for school administration and teachers to help track the attendance and wellbeing of students in class. Each teacher can keep track of their students for each period of the day, up to seven periods per day,  initiating and receiving results of a student survey (taken on student version of the app). These results are then presented to staff to help determine what areas of their mood or life they need help with from the teacher/administration.

This Repository is for the front end of the app, all screen and features. The data and back end utility is being provided by Marcus Westbrooks, the app's main developer.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

This project was truly a good learning experience for me. It helped me to practice and really develop my skills in MVVM formatting of my code, ensuring clean delineations of my view, models/data and my view models to connect all the data together.

It was also a good exercise in learning how to refactor code into separate views to clean up my views and make the whole flow of the app less confusing and easier for anyone to pick up and use. Refactoring also gives you the ability to make views and displays work and look how you want them to, as they are way less finnicky when individual elements rather than building everything in the same view. Some of the biggest challenges I faced on this project was how the formatting of the data and information display cards, as well as the filter views to appear on screen and influence how the pages interact.

This project also helped me practice my data flow skills. Learning how to properly call, reference and pass data around different views was a good challenge and learning opportunity. Utilizing Environment object and a view model to carry my data throughout the app was a very helpful tool that I will be certainly using down the road in future apps. This whole experience was a fantastic learning experience from beginning to end.
